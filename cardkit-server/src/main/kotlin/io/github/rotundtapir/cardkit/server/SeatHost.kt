/**
 * The server-side [Player] for one seat — the exact mirror of an app's `ChannelPlayer`, but backed
 * by the network. The [io.github.rotundtapir.cardkit.core.GameDriver] calls [decide] on the actor for
 * each turn; this either plays the bot (empty seat, or a human who dropped/idled) or prompts the
 * human and waits for their action.
 *
 * Bot substitution and seat reclaim fall out of the driver loop for free: [occupant] is read at the
 * start of every [decide], so a disconnect makes the next turn bot-played and a reconnect (which
 * sets [occupant] back) makes the following turn human again. The reclaim happens at the turn
 * boundary because that is when [decide] next reads [occupant].
