/**
 * Opaque session tokens issued at [Hello] and their current room+seat binding. A reconnecting client
 * re-presents its token to reclaim its seat. Tokens are unguessable (16 random bytes) so they double
 * as bearer credentials for a seat — no accounts, no passwords.
 *
 * Bindings are bounded two ways so the map can't grow without limit on a long-lived process: they are
 * [clear]ed when a seat is vacated cleanly (leave/disband), and any binding untouched for longer than
 * the TTL is [evictStale]d by a periodic sweep. A live game refreshes its seated tokens each time a
 * client (re)connects, so an in-progress match never has its token swept out from under it.
